The Media Suite consists of four key components, all listed in Clariah Tools:

- [**clariah-mediasuite**](https://github.com/CLARIAH/clariah-mediasuite) - the back-end web server
- [**mediasuite-website**](https://github.com/CLARIAH/mediasuite-website) - the static content of the website, such as layout, help and tutorials
- [**labo-components**](https://github.com/CLARIAH/labo-components) - the front-end components that determine the dynamic content of the website, such as search results
- [**labo-workspace-components**](https://github.com/CLARIAH/labo-workspace-components) - the front-end components that handle the user's personal workspace, for example bookmarking results and saving queries

The source code repositories are private. The Clariah Media Suite makes use of a number of APIs, also stored in private repositories.
